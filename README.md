## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid

### What I learned

This project helped me practice using CSS Grid combined with CSS Flexible Box (Flexbox) for simple layouts, outside of a learning platform:

```css
/* container */
body {
	display: grid;
	grid-template-columns: 3fr 6.5fr 6fr 6.5fr 6.5fr 3fr;
	column-gap: 3rem;
	grid-template-rows: 5rem 0.33fr 0.33fr 5rem;
	row-gap: 2rem;
}
```

```css
/* one child element */
body > article:first-child {
	grid-column-start: 2;
	grid-column-end: 4;
	grid-row-start: 2;
	grid-row-end: 3;
}
```

### Continued development

Next, I would like to use CSS Grid on more complex layouts.
